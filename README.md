# Captchua

Hi, this is just a mini project that I create for fun

This isn't really a real "Captcha", but more to be a minigame

The player will never solve the "Captcha" successfully, instead, more weird prompts will appear

If you managed to solve it all successfully, the game will end

Otherwise, you will receive an error at the end

(The game is finite)
